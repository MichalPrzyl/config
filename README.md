# Config
It is my shortcut to install new environments.
This repo contains configs for some of the tools I use.

## Nvim config
Install neovim, then install `kickstart.nvim`.
After that copy code from this repository's `init.lua` file into your file (you should have one after installing kickstart.nvim).

In future I will add:
- simple configuration for plain nvim to just start working without installing package managers, kickstarts and other stuff, which is unnecessary to work (for example on production server)
- step-by-step instruction how to install neovim and kickstart.nvim

## ZSH config
Now it only contains config for "agnoster" theme from "oh-my-zsh". Really nice looking one!
