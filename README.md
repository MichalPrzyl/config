# Nvim config
Install neovim, then install `kickstart.nvim`.
After that copy code from this repository's `init.lua` file into your file (you should have one after installing kickstart.nvim).

In future I will add:
- simple configuration for plain nvim to just start working without installing package managers, kickstarts and other stuff, which is unnecessary to work (for example on production server)
- step-by-step instruction how to install neovim and kickstart.nvim

WQhat is better:
synth-shell or zsh?
Or... Can these two works together?
